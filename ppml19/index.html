                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>This one day workshop focuses on privacy preserving techniques for training, inference, and
                    disclosure in large scale data analysis, both in the distributed and centralized settings. We have
                    observed increasing interest of the ML community in leveraging cryptographic techniques such as
                    Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for privacy preserving training and
                    inference, as well as Differential Privacy (DP) for disclosure. Simultaneously, the systems security
                    and cryptography community has proposed various secure frameworks for ML. We encourage both theory
                    and application-oriented submissions exploring a range of approaches, including:</p>

                    <li class="list-group-item speaker">centralized and decentralized protocols for learning on
                        encrypted data</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item speaker">differential privacy: theory, applications, and implementations
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item speaker">statistical notions of privacy including relaxations of
                        differential privacy</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item speaker">empirical and theoretical comparisons between different notions

                    <li class="list-group-item speaker">trade-offs between privacy and utility</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We think it will be very valuable to have a forum to unify different perspectives and start a
                    discussion about the relative merits of each approach. The workshop will also serve as a venue for
                    networking people from different communities interested in this problem, and hopefully foster
                    fruitful long-term collaboration.</p>

                                    Significant gaps between legal and technical thinking around data privacy make it
                                    hard to exactly understand how legal standards apply to economic mechanisms that use
                                    personal information. Such mechanisms may apply technical solutions constructed
                                    under frameworks such as differential privacy and k-anonymity. However, there is a
                                    lot of uncertainty regarding how these mathematical concepts meet legal standards.
                                    As a result, arguments that mechanisms apply sufficient technical privacy measures
                                    for satisfying legal privacy often lack rigor, and their conclusions are uncertain.
                                    The uncertainty is exacerbated by a litany of successful privacy attacks on privacy
                                    measures thought to meet legal expectations but then shown to fall short of doing
                                    so.

                                    We examine strategies for introducing mathematical rigor into the analysis, so as to
                                    make formal claims and prove “legal theorems” that technical privacy measures meet
                                    legal expectations. For that, we explore some of the gaps between these two very
                                    different approaches, and present initial strategies towards bridging these gaps
                                    considering examples from US and EU law.

                                    differentially private leakage during computation, and, exploiting the parallelism
                                    that this affords, we construct an MPC protocol that can perform at national scales.
                                    Concretely, we compute histograms on 300 million inputs in 4.18 minutes, and we
                                    perform sparse matrix factorization, which is used in recommendation systems, on 20
                                    million inputs in under 6 minutes. These problems have broad, real-world
                                    applications, and, at this scale, we could imagine supporting the CensusBureau, or a
                                    large company such as Amazon. For comparison, the largest experiments in GraphSC [6]
                                    and OblivGraph [18] had 1M inputs, and required 13 hours and 2 hours of runtime,
                                    respectively, while using 4 times the number of processors that we employ.
                                    End-to-end, our construction is 320X faster than OblivGraph.

                                    Privacy concerns are becoming a major obstacle to using data in the ways we want.
                                    How can data scientists make use of potentially sensitive data, while providing
                                    rigorous privacy guarantees to the individuals who provided data? Over the last
                                    decade, differential privacy has emerged as the de facto gold standard of privacy
                                    preserving data analysis. Differential privacy ensures that an algorithm does not
                                    overfit to the individuals in the database by guaranteeing that if any single entry
                                    in the database were to be changed, then the algorithm would still have
                                    approximately the same distribution over outputs.<br />

                                    In this talk, we will focus on recent advances in differential privacy for dynamic
                                    databases, where the content of the database evolves over time as new data are
                                    acquired. First, we will see how to extend differentially private algorithms for
                                    static databases to the dynamic setting, with relatively small loss in the
                                    privacy-accuracy tradeoff. Next, we see algorithms for privately detecting changes
                                    in data composition. We will conclude with a discussion of open problems in this
                                    space, including the use of differential privacy for other types of data
                                    dynamism.<br />

                                    We show that garbled circuits offer a practical choice for secure evaluation of
                                    neural network classifiers, comparable with complex, specialized protocols using
                                    less robust assumptions, many rounds of interaction, and/or tailor-made neural
                                    networks. In particular, we develop a scheme for garbling ``off the shelf''
                                    pre-trained neural networks, where the only model preprocessing required is a mild
                                    discretization step as opposed to requiring a specialized SFE-friendly model to be
                                    independently trained. Moreover, as our solution is a garbling scheme, it inherits a
                                    much more diverse range of applications than non-garbling-based solutions, perhaps
                                    most notably, efficient compilers for the malicious setting. At the protocol level,
                                    we start with the garbling scheme of Ball, Malkin, and Rosulek (ACM CCS 2016) for
                                    arithmetic circuits and introduce new optimizations for modern neural network
                                    activation functions. We develop fancygarbling, the first implementation of the
                                    BMR16 garbling scheme along with our new optimizations, as part of heavily optimized
                                    garbled-circuits tool that is driven by a TensorFlow classifier description. We
                                    evaluate our constructions on a wide range of neural networks. We find that our
                                    approach is up to 100x more efficient than straight-forward boolean garbling. It is
                                    also roughly 40% more efficient than DeepSecure (Rouhani et al., DAC 2018), a recent
                                    garbled-circuit-based approach for secure neural network evaluation, which
                                    incorporates significant optimization techniques for boolean circuits. Furthermore,
                                    our approach provides competitive performance tradeoffs (efficiency and latency vs.
                                    communication) also when compared with non-garbled-circuit approaches.

                                    We propose an algorithm for the adaptation of the learning rate for stochastic
                                    gradient descent (SGD) that avoids the need for validation set use. The idea for the
                                    adaptiveness comes from the technique of extrapolation: to get an estimate for the
                                    error against the gradient flow which underlies SGD, we compare the result obtained
                                    by one full step and two half-steps. The algorithm is applied in two separate
                                    frameworks: federated and differentially private learning. Using examples of deep
                                    neural networks we empirically show that the method works robustly in the case of
                                    federated learning unlike commonly used optimisation methods. We also show that the
                                    adaptive algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art hyperparameter search
                                    methods and commonly used optimisation methods for differentially privately
                                    training.

                                    Modern machine learning models exhibit amazing accuracy on tasks from image
                                    classification to natural-language processing, but accuracy does not tell the entire
                                    story of what these models have learned. Does a model memorize and leak its training
                                    data? Does it “accidentally" learn privacy-violating tasks uncorrelated with its
                                    training objective? Can it hide a backdoor introduced by an adversary? All of these
                                    are examples of unwanted learning, which we need to understand and mitigate in order

                                    A number of recent works have demonstrated that API access to machine learning
                                    models leaks information about the dataset records used to train the models.
                                    Further, the work of [9] shows that such membership inference attacks (MIAs) may be
                                    sufficient to construct a stronger breed of attribute inference attacks (AIAs),
                                    which given a partial view of a record can guess the missing attributes. In this
                                    work, we show (to the contrary) that MIA may not be sufficient to build a successful
                                    AIA. This is because the latter requires the ability to distinguish between similar
                                    records (differing only in a few attributes), and, as we demonstrate, the current
                                    breed of MIA are unsuccessful in distinguishing member records from similar
                                    non-member records. We thus propose a relaxed notion of AIA, whose goal is to only
                                    approximately guess the missing attributes and argue that such an attack is more
                                    likely to be successful, if MIA is to be used as a subroutine for inferring training
                                    record attributes.

                                    In this paper we present a practical protocol for secure ridge regression. We
                                    develop the necessary secure linear algebra tools, using only basic arithmetic over
                                    prime fields. In particular, we will show how to solve linear systems of equations
                                    and compute matrix inverses efficiently, using appropriate secure random
                                    self-reductions of these problems. The distinguishing feature of our approach is
                                    that the use of secure fixed-point arithmetic is avoided entirely, while
                                    circumventing the need for rational reconstruction at any stage as well. We
                                    demonstrate the potential of our protocol in a standard setting for
                                    information-theoretically secure multiparty computation, tolerating a dishonest
                                    minority of passively corrupt parties. Using the MPyC framework, which is based on
                                    threshold secret sharing over finite fields, we show how to handle large datasets
                                    efficiently, achieving practically the same root-mean-square errors as Scikit-learn.
                                    Moreover, we do not assume that any (part) of the datasets is held privately by any
                                    of the parties, which makes our protocol much more versatile than existing
                                    solutions.

                        We show that garbled circuits offer a practical choice for secure evaluation of neural network
                        classifiers, comparable with complex, specialized protocols using less robust assumptions, many
                        rounds of interaction, and/or tailor-made neural networks. In particular, we develop a scheme
                        for garbling ``off the shelf'' pre-trained neural networks, where the only model preprocessing
                        required is a mild discretization step as opposed to requiring a specialized SFE-friendly model
                        to be independently trained. Moreover, as our solution is a garbling scheme, it inherits a much
                        more diverse range of applications than non-garbling-based solutions, perhaps most notably,
                        efficient compilers for the malicious setting. At the protocol level, we start with the garbling
                        scheme of Ball, Malkin, and Rosulek (ACM CCS 2016) for arithmetic circuits and introduce new
                        optimizations for modern neural network activation functions. We develop fancygarbling, the
                        first implementation of the BMR16 garbling scheme along with our new optimizations, as part of
                        heavily optimized garbled-circuits tool that is driven by a TensorFlow classifier description.
                        We evaluate our constructions on a wide range of neural networks. We find that our approach is
                        up to 100x more efficient than straight-forward boolean garbling. It is also roughly 40% more
                        efficient than DeepSecure (Rouhani et al., DAC 2018), a recent garbled-circuit-based approach
                        for secure neural network evaluation, which incorporates significant optimization techniques for
                        boolean circuits. Furthermore, our approach provides competitive performance tradeoffs
                        (efficiency and latency vs. communication) also when compared with non-garbled-circuit
                        approaches.

                        In this paper we present a practical protocol for secure ridge regression. We develop the
                        necessary secure linear algebra tools, using only basic arithmetic over prime fields. In
                        particular, we will show how to solve linear systems of equations and compute matrix inverses
                        efficiently, using appropriate secure random self-reductions of these problems. The
                        distinguishing feature of our approach is that the use of secure fixed-point arithmetic is
                        avoided entirely, while circumventing the need for rational reconstruction at any stage as well.
                        We demonstrate the potential of our protocol in a standard setting for information-theoretically
                        secure multiparty computation, tolerating a dishonest minority of passively corrupt parties.
                        Using the MPyC framework, which is based on threshold secret sharing over finite fields, we show
                        how to handle large datasets efficiently, achieving practically the same root-mean-square errors
                        as Scikit-learn. Moreover, we do not assume that any (part) of the datasets is held privately by
                        any of the parties, which makes our protocol much more versatile than existing solutions.

                        Recently, there has been a wealth of effort devoted to the design of protocols for secure
                        machine learning algorithms. In particular, much of this is aimed at ensuring predictions from
                        highly-accurate deep neural network (NN) models are secure. However, as NNs are trained on data,
                        a key question is how such models can be trained securely. The few prior works on secure NN
                        training have focused either on designing custom protocols for existing training algorithms, or
                        on developing tailored training algorithms and then applying generic secure protocols. In this
                        work, we propose to simultaneously design training algorithms alongside a secure protocol for
                        computing that algorithm, incorporating optimizations on both fronts. We present QUOTIENT, a new
                        method for discretized training of deep neural networks designed to be evaluated in secure
                        computation, along with a secure two-party protocol for it. QUOTIENT incorporates important
                        components of state-of-the-art neural network training such as layer normalization and adaptize
                        learning rates, and improves upon the state-of-the-art in neural network training in two-party
                        computation. Compared to the state-of-the prior work, we obtain an improvement of 50X in time
                        and 6 in accuracy. Additionally, our method is the first practical secure 2PC framework for
                        neural network training over WAN.

                        sophisticated, powered by increased availability of data. However, users' audio data needs to be
                        guarded while enforcing data-protection regulations, such as the GDPR law and the COPPA law. To
                        check the unauthorized use of audio data, we propose an audio auditor for users to audit speech
                        recognition models. Specifically, users can check whether their audio recordings were used as a
                        member of the model's training dataset or not. In this paper, we focus our work on a
                        DNN-HMM-based automatic speech recognition model over the TIMIT audio data. As a
                        proof-of-concept, the success rate of participant-level membership inference can reach up to
                        90\% with eight audio samples per user, resulting in an audio auditor.

                        A number of recent works have demonstrated that API access to machine learning models leaks
                        information about the dataset records used to train the models. Further, the work of [9] shows
                        that such membership inference attacks (MIAs) may be sufficient to construct a stronger breed of
                        attribute inference attacks (AIAs), which given a partial view of a record can guess the missing
                        attributes. In this work, we show (to the contrary) that MIA may not be sufficient to build a
                        successful AIA. This is because the latter requires the ability to distinguish between similar
                        records (differing only in a few attributes), and, as we demonstrate, the current breed of MIA
                        are unsuccessful in distinguishing member records from similar non-member records. We thus
                        propose a relaxed notion of AIA, whose goal is to only approximately guess the missing
                        attributes and argue that such an attack is more likely to be successful, if MIA is to be used
                        as a subroutine for inferring training record attributes.

                        We propose an algorithm for the adaptation of the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent
                        (SGD) that avoids the need for validation set use. The idea for the adaptiveness comes from the
                        technique of extrapolation: to get an estimate for the error against the gradient flow which
                        underlies SGD, we compare the result obtained by one full step and two half-steps. The algorithm
                        is applied in two separate frameworks: federated and differentially private learning. Using
                        examples of deep neural networks we empirically show that the method works robustly in the case
                        of federated learning unlike commonly used optimisation methods. We also show that the adaptive

                        Differential privacy is a mathematical framework for privacy-preserving data analysis. Changing
                        the hyperparameters of a differentially private algorithm allows one to trade off privacy and
                        utility in a principled way. Quantifying this trade-off in advance is essential to
                        decision-makers tasked with deciding how much privacy can be provided in a particular
                        application while keeping acceptable utility. Analytical utility guarantees offer a simple tool
                        to reason about this trade-off, but are generally only available for relatively simple problems.
                        For more complex tasks, such as training neural networks under differential privacy, the utility
                        achieved by a given algorithm can only be measured empirically. This paper presents a Bayesian
                        optimization methodology for efficiently characterizing the privacy--utility trade-off of any

                        We consider the problem of obfuscating sensitive information while preserving utility, and we
                        propose a machine-learning approach inspired by the generative adversarial networks paradigm.
                        The idea is to set up two nets: the generator, that tries to produce an optimal obfuscation
                        mechanism to protect the data, and the classifier, that tries to de-obfuscate the data. By
                        letting the two nets compete against each other, the mechanism improves its degree of
                        protection, until an equilibrium is reached. We apply our method to the case of location
                        privacy, and we perform experiments on synthetic data and on real data from the Gowalla dataset.
                        We evaluate the privacy of the mechanism not only by its capacity to defeat the classifier, but
                        also in terms of the Bayes error, which represents the strongest possible adversary. We compare
                        the privacy-utility tradeoff of our method with that of the planar Laplace mechanism used in
                        geo-indistinguishability, showing favorable results. Like the Laplace mechanism, our system can
                        be deployed at the user end for protecting his location in case of sporadic uses of
                        location-based services.

                        company such as Amazon. For comparison, the largest experiments in GraphSC [6] and OblivGraph
                        [18] had 1M inputs, and required 13 hours and 2 hours of runtime, respectively, while using 4
                        times the number of processors that we employ. End-to-end, our construction is 320X faster than
                        OblivGraph.

                        We devise an efficient and data-oblivious algorithm for solving a bounded integral linear system
                        of arbitrary rank over the rational numbers via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, using
                        finite-field arithmetic. This particular problem setting stems from our goal to run the
                        algorithm as a secure multiparty computation (MPC). Beyond MPC, our algorithm could be valuable
                        in other scenarios, like secure enclaves in CPUs, where data-obliviousness is crucial for
                        protecting secrets. We compute the Moore-Penrose inverse over a finite field of sufficiently
                        large order, so that we can recover the rational solution from the solution over the finite
                        field. Previous work by Cramer, Kiltz and Padro (CRYPTO 2007) proposes a constant-rounds
                        protocol for computing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse over a finite field. The asymptotic
                        complexity (by which we mean the number of secure multiplications) of their solution is $O(m^4 +
                        n^2 m)$, where $m$ and $n$, $m\leq n$, are the dimensions of the linear system. To reduce the
                        number of secure multiplications, we sacrifice the constant-rounds property and propose a
                        protocol for computing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse over the rational numbers in a linear
                        number of rounds, requiring only $O(m^2n)$ secure multiplications. To obtain the common
                        denominator of the pseudoinverse, required for constructing an integer-representation of the
                        pseudoinverse, we generalize a result by Ben-Israel for computing the squared volume of a
                        matrix. Also, we show how to precondition a symmetric matrix to achieve generic rank profile
                        while preserving symmetry and being able to remove the preconditioner after it has served its
                        purpose. These results may be of independent interest.

                        In this paper, we study the problem of privately computing quantities that come in the form of
                        \emph{averages over pairs} of data points $U_{f,n}=\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i,j}f(x_i,x_j)$ for
                        some pairwise function $f$. $U_{f,n}$ is known as the (degree 2) $U$-statistic with kernel $f$
                        and is an unbiased estimate of $U_f=\mathbb E_{x,x'\sim \mu}[f(x,x')]$ with minimum variance.
                        The class of $U$-statistics covers many statistical estimates of interest, including Gini mean
                        difference, Kendall's tau coefficient, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney hypothesis test and Area under the
                        ROC Curve (AUC). They are also commonly used as empirical risk measures for machine learning
                        problems such as ranking, clustering and metric learning. In this context, our contribution is
                        the design and analysis of several protocols with privacy and utility guarantees. (1) We
                        introduce a generic, natural LDP protocol based on quantizing the data into $k$ bins and
                        applying $k$-ary randomized response. We show that under an assumption on either the kernel
                        function $f$ or the data distribution $\mu$, the aggregator can construct an estimate of
                        $U_{f,n}$ with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of $O(1/\sqrt{n}\epsilon)$. (2) For the case of the
                        AUC, whose kernel does not satisfy the regularity assumption required by our previous protocol,
                        we design a specialized protocol based on hierarchical histograms that achieves MSE
                        $O(1/n\epsilon^2)$ for arbitrary data distribution. (3) Under a slight relaxation of the local
                        model in which we allow pairs of users $i$ and $j$ to compute a randomized version of
                        $f(x_i,x_j)$ with 2-party secure computation, we show that we can design a protocol with MSE of
                        $O(1/n\epsilon^2)$, without any assumption on the kernel function or data distribution and with
                        communication linear in the number of users $n$. (4) Finally, we provide some experiments on
                        synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed protocols.

                        In 1994, Feige, Kilian, and Naor proposed a simple protocol for secure 3-way comparison of
                        integers a and b from the range [0, 2]. Their observation is that for p = 7, the Legendre symbol
                        (x | p) coincides with the sign of x for x = a − b ∈ [−2, 2], thus reducing secure comparison to
                        secure evaluation of the Legendre symbol. More recently, in 2011, Yu generalized this idea to
                        handle secure comparisons for integers from substantially larger ranges [0,d], essentially by
                        searching for primes for which the Legendre symbol coincides with the sign function on [−d,d].
                        In this work, we present new comparison protocols based on the Legendre symbol that additionally
                        employ some form of error correction. We relax the prime search by requiring that the Legendre
                        symbol encodes the sign function in a noisy fashion only. Practically, we use the majority vote
                        over a window of 2k + 1 adjacent Legendre symbols, for small positive integers k. Our technique
                        significantly increases the comparison range: e.g., for a modulus of 60 bits, d increases by a
                        factor of 2.9 (for k = 1) and 5.4 (for k = 2) respectively. We give a practical method to find
                        primes with suitable noisy encodings. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our comparison
                        protocol by applying it in a secure neural network classifier for the MNIST dataset. Concretely,
                        we discuss a secure multiparty computation based on the binarized multi-layer perceptron of
                        Hubara et al., using our comparison for the second and third layers.

                        The ability to elicit information through automated classification of personal texts has
                        significant economic and societal value, as manifested by many useful applications in
                        surveillance, e-commerce, and mental health care, to name a few. Regardless of the clear
                        benefits, giving applications access to personal texts can easily lead to (un)intentional
                        privacy violations. We propose the first privacy-preserving solution for text classification
                        that is provably secure. Our method, which is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC),
                        encompasses both feature extraction from texts, and subsequent classification with logistic
                        regression and tree ensembles. When using our secure text classification method, the application
                        does not learn anything about the text, and the author of the text does not learn anything about
                        the text classification model used by the application. We perform end-to-end experiments with an
                        application for detecting hate speech against women and immigrants, demonstrating excellent

                        In this paper, we study two different approaches to enable data sharing for learning tasks while
                        preserving data privacy. The first approach is to share representation learning models with
                        multiple parties, for which we choose to use a differentially private autoencoder-based
                        generative model (DP-AuGM). The second approach is to share generated data with multiple parties
                        through generative models, for which we choose to use a differentially private variational
                        autoencoder-based generative model (DP-VaeGM). To achieve differential privacy, we train both
                        models by adding differential privacy noise to the gradient. We evaluate the performance of our
                        two proposed approaches across various differential privacy budgets. We also present the

                        Quantification of the privacy loss associated with a randomised algorithm has become an active
                        area of research and (ε,δ)-differential privacy has arisen as the standard measure of it. We
                        propose a numerical method for evaluating the parameters of differential privacy for algorithms
                        with continuous one dimensional output. In this way the parameters ε and δ can be evaluated, for
                        example, for the subsampled multidimensional Gaussian mechanism which is also the underlying
                        mechanism of differentially private stochastic gradient descent. The proposed method is based on
                        a numerical approximation of an integral formula which gives the exact (ε,δ)-values. The
                        approximation is carried out by discretising the integral and by evaluating discrete
                        convolutions using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. We give theoretical error bounds which
                        show the convergence of the approximation and guarantee its accuracy to an arbitrary degree.
                        Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques illustrate the efficacy of the method.

                        their sensitive data. In particular, we assume that every party knows specific features of an
                        overlapping set of people. Using a secure implementation of an advanced hidden set intersection
                        protocol and a privacy-preserving Gradient Descent algorithm, we are able to train a Ridge,
                        LASSO or SVM model over the intersection of people in their data sets. Both the hidden set
                        intersection protocol and privacy-preserving LASSO implementation are unprecedented in
                        literature.

                        With the advent of mobile and smart-home devices such as Amazon Alexa or the Google Assistant
                        providing voice-based interfaces, voice data is commonly transferred to corresponding cloud
                        services. This is necessary to quickly and accurately perform tasks like automatic speaker
                        verification (ASV) and speech recognition (ASR) that heavily rely on machine learning. While
                        enabling intriguing new applications, this development also poses significant risks: Voice data
                        is highly sensitive since it contains biometric information of the speaker as well as the spoken
                        words. Thus, the security and privacy of billions of end-users is at stake if voice data is not
                        protected properly. When developing privacy-preserving solutions to mitigate such risks, it is
                        also important to keep in mind that the involved machine learning models represent intellectual
                        property of the service providers and therefore must not be revealed to users. The contribution
                        of our work is three-fold: First, we present an efficient architecture for privacy-preserving
                        ASV via outsourced secure two-party computation (STPC). Compared to existing solutions based on
                        homomorphic encryption (HE), the verification process is 4000x faster, while retaining a high
                        verification accuracy and guaranteeing unlinkability, irreversibility, and renewability of
                        stored biometric data. Since cryptographic secure computation protocols currently do not scale
                        to more involved tasks like ASR, we then present VoiceGuard, an architecture that efficiently
                        protects speech processing inside a trusted execution environment (TEE). We provide a
                        proof-of-concept implementation and evaluate it on speech recognition tasks isolated with Intel
                        SGX, a widely available TEE implementation, demonstrating even real time processing
                        capabilities. Finally, we present Offline Model Guard (OMG) to enable privacy-preserving speech
                        processing on the predominant mobile computing platform ARM even in offline scenarios. Beyond
                        relying on the Intel SGX equivalent ARM TrustZone, we employ the security architecture SANCTUARY
                        (NDSS'19) for strict hardware-enforced isolation from all other system components. Our prototype
                        implementation performs privacy-preserving keyword recognition using TensorFlow Lite in real
                        time.

                        Voice-enabled interactions provide more human-like experiences in many popular IoT systems.
                        Cloud-based speech analysis services extract useful information from voice input using speech
                        recognition techniques. The voice signal is a rich resource that discloses several possible
                        states of a speaker, such as emotional state, confidence and stress levels, physical condition,
                        age, gender, and personal traits. Service providers can build a very accurate profile of a
                        user's demographic category, personal preferences, and may compromise privacy. To address this
                        problem, a privacy-preserving intermediate layer between users and cloud services is proposed to
                        sanitize the voice input. It aims to maintain utility while preserving user privacy. It achieves
                        this by collecting real time speech data and analyzes the signal to ensure privacy protection
                        prior to sharing of this data with services providers. Precisely, the sensitive representations
                        are extracted from the raw signal by using transformation functions and then wrapped it via
                        voice conversion technology. Experimental evaluation based on emotion recognition to assess the
                        efficacy of the proposed method shows that identification of sensitive emotional state of the
                        speaker is reduced by 96 %.

                        Machine Learning models, and specially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are at the heart of
                        many day-to-day applications like image classification and speech recognition. The need for
                        evaluating such models whilst preserving the privacy of the input provided increases as the
                        models are used for more information-sensitive tasks like DNA analysis or facial recognition.
                        Research on evaluating CNNs securely has been very active during the last couple of years,
                        e.g.~Mohassel \& Zhang (S\&P'17) and Liu et al.~(CCS'17), leading to very efficient frameworks
                        like SecureNN (ePrint:2018:442), which can perform evaluation of some CNNs with a multplicative
                        overhead of only $17$--$33$ with respect to evaluation in the clear. We contribute to this line
                        of research by introducing a technique from the Machine Learning domain, namely
                        \emph{quantization}, which allows us to scale secure evaluation of CNNs to much larger networks
                        without the accuracy loss that could happen by adapting the network to the MPC setting.
                        Quantization is motivated by the deployment of ML models in resource-constrained devices, and we
                        show it to be useful in the MPC setting as well. Our results show that it is possible to
                        evaluate \emph{realistic} models---specifically Google's MobileNets line of models for image
                        recognition---within seconds. Our performance gain can be mainly attributed to two key
                        ingredients: One is the use of the three-party MPC protocol based on replicated secret sharing
                        by Araki et al. (S\&P'17), whose multiplication protocol only requires sending one number per
                        party. Moreover, it allows to evaluate arbitrary long dot products at the same communication
                        cost of a single multiplication, which facilitates matrix multiplications considerably. The
                        second main ingredient is the use of arithmetic modulo $2^{64}$, for which we develop a set of
                        primitives of indepedent interest that are necessary for the quantization like comparison and
                        truncation by a secret shift.

                        Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA).
                        In these attacks, an adversary uses the outputs of a model to infer whether a given example was
                        part of the training dataset. Such knowledge threatens individuals' privacy when the classifier
                        is associated to sensitive domains such as medical research, law enforcement, or financial
                        services. However, the attack effectiveness has so far only been evaluated by computing the
                        accuracy of the attack over the whole population. In this paper we investigate whether such
                        average-oriented evaluation actually reflects the impact of these attacks across subgroups of
                        the population. We introduce a new notion: disparate vulnerability, which, similarly to
                        disparate impact and disparate mistreatment in fairness, captures the differential impact that
                        privacy attacks impose on subgroups. We propose a framework to quantify disparate vulnerability
                        in an efficient manner. This framework relies on a new definition, MIA-indistinguishability,
                        that captures the resistance of a model to MIA. Based on this definition, we provide a method to
                        compute the privacy loss for a given subgroup, in the presence of MIA adversaries. Our
                        theoretical analysis reveals that disparate vulnerability has two main roots. First, unbalanced
                        training data across subgroups. Second, disparate overfitting across subgroups, i.e., the model
                        under attack exhibits different behavior in training and testin for different subgroups. We
                        empirically evaluate these findings on several classifiers trained to predict the age of
                        individuals in the ADULT dataset. We find that, regardless of the architecture of a classifier,
                        underrepresented minorities are more vulnerable to MIA than others, whereas the majority is the
                        least vulnerable to MIA. Finally, we show that a common technique to mitigate privacy
                        leakage---differentially-private training does not effectively address disparate vulnerability.
